== Quality Requirements


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****

.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Tree

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.


****
The Quality Tree is a structured representation of the key quality attributes of our system. The root represents the overall concept of "Quality," which is then divided into different branches representing essential quality attributes derived from our Quality Goals (section 1.2). Each branch further expands into measurable and concrete evaluation scenarios.

Below is an outline of the Quality Tree:

* **Quality**

    * **Testability**

        * Maintain at least 85% code coverage.

        * Implement automated testing for all major functionalities.

    * **Usability**

        * Ensure an intuitive user interface suitable for all age groups.

        * Conduct usability tests with different user demographics.

    * **Portability**

        * Deploy the application on various devices with minimal performance impact.

    * **Security & Privacy**

        * Restrict user data access to authorized individuals.

        * Implement secure authentication mechanisms.

    * **Performance**

        * Maintain consistent response times regardless of concurrent users.

        * Perform load testing to simulate heavy traffic conditions.

Each of these categories will have detailed scenarios describing expected system behavior under different conditions.

=== Quality Scenarios

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.

==== Usage Scenarios

|===
| Scenario ID | Scenario Description 
| UQ-01 | A user selects an answer, and the system provides feedback within one second. 
| UQ-02 | A user requests a hint, and the AI assistant provides contextual guidance without revealing the answer. 
| UQ-03 | The application maintains stable response times (under 500ms per request) even with 100 concurrent users. 
| UQ-04 | A new user navigates the application for the first time and completes a game without requiring external guidance. 
| UQ-05 | A request to fetch a new question returns a response from the database within 300ms. 
|===

==== Change Scenarios

|===
| Scenario ID | Scenario Description 
| CQ-01 | Integration of a new LLM model should not degrade performance beyond a 10% increase in response time. 
| CQ-02 | Adding a new game mode should not require modifications to more than 10% of the existing codebase. 
| CQ-03 | Migrating the database to a new provider should require only configuration changes without altering business logic. 
| CQ-04 | Enhancing security policies should not introduce more than 5% additional latency per request. 
|===

By defining these scenarios, we ensure that our system meets stakeholder expectations and maintains high-quality standards throughout its lifecycle.
