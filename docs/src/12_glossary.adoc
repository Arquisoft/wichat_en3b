.Contents
The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use when discussing the system.

You can also see the glossary as a source for translations if you work in multi-language teams.

.Motivation
You should clearly define your terms so that all stakeholders:

* Have an identical understanding of these terms.
* Do not use synonyms and homonyms.

.Form
A table with columns <Term> and <Definition>.

Potentially more columns in case you need translations.

.Further Information
See https://docs.arc42.org/section-12/[Glossary] in the arc42 documentation.
