.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. 
Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* ADR (https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[Documenting Architecture Decisions]) for every important decision
* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions] in the arc42 documentation.
There you will find links and examples about ADR.

| **ELEMENT** | **OPTIONS** | **DECISION** | **REASON**
| **Architecture** | Microservices, frontend & backend | Microservices | We chose the microservices architecture for its scalability, flexibility and decoupling, allowing the game to evolve easily and handle increased loads efficiently.
| **Language** | Java, JavaScript | JavaScript | The initial prototype was written using JavaScript so we decided to keep on with it.
| **Backend** framework | SpringBoot, Express, Node.js | Express, Node.js | Since we chose JavaScript as the language, this options would make integration with the front easier.
| **Database** | MongoDB (NoSQL), PostgreSQL, MySQL | MongoDB | MongoDB was the database used in the prototype of the project so we continued with it. It allows flexible storage of questions and answers, along with horizontal scalability.
| **Cloud service** | Oracle Cloud, Azure Cloud | Oracle cloud | We started using Azure but Oracle offers more flexibility and it's easier to use so we finally decided to change.
| **Frontend** | React | React | Although we had never worked with it before, it is a powerful framework which provides predefined and reusable components.
| **Deployment** | Docker | Docker | It is a fast option and allows an easy maintaining of the application. Also, it was the option used in the initial prototype.
| **LLM** | Empathy (Mistral, Qwen), Gemini | Mistral | We tried the three options and they all met our needs for the project but we decided to stick with Mistral, which was an option in the initial prototye.
| **Wikidata** | Direct HTTP request, Wikidata Query Service (WDQS), MediaWiki Action API, Wikibase REST API, Dumps | WDQS | We decided to use the Wikidata Query Service, with queries in SPARQL, making data retrieval structured and efficient without overloading our backend.
| **Component navigation** | React-router, Link | React-router | This option provides efficient route and state management, preventing component conflicts and enhancing user experience.
