== Introduction and Goals

The goal of this application is to develop an application which functionality is similar to the “Saber Y Ganar” Spanish program on TV. Users will have to choose an answer in several questions proposed extracted from WikiData, these questions will be automatically generated by its API.

Furthermore, for the development of this application the use of GitHub is required to have a repository with all members of the development team using several tools provided by this service. In addition to that the application will have to save the entrance of different users on a database, allowing them to make different tracking and having previous results of that specific user. 

Also, it must be said that during each question an IA assistant should be helping the user in case of need. This would require us, the development team, to use different LLM that is still to be decided which one will be use. 

Our overall goal is to generate user satisfaction while playing this game, trying out different modes and using certain aids that, when used correctly, will be key to achieving a good number of points and placing yourself in a good position in the rankings.

=== Requirements Overview

==== Functional Requirements

Related to the WebApp Service: 

    - The game must allow users to play a game with several rounds and each of them having 4 possible answers with only one correct. Also, several modes can be choosen in order to make the game different each time.

    - The application must save the correct answers and tracking them in a good way to the data base for having correct stadistics that then can be check by the user, in its home page. 

    - The system for hints must work properly in order to not use them in all rounds. Only when the cost can be payed correctly. 

Related to the LLM Service: 

    - The game must have a chat that needs to have a conversation with the user when it is required, giving clues but without saying the correct answer under any circumstance.

Related to the Question Service: 

    - This service must provide different possible questions and save them in the database, then randomly one will be choosen. 

Related to the Gateway Service: 

    - The game should have the endpoints in this service, making all the application working around it.

Related to the User/Auth Service: 

    - This two services are under the same directory. They will be in charge of adding users to the aplication and then allow them to enter with their credetials. Moreover, this service (userservice) must be also in charge of saving the stadistics of the user. 

==== Non-Functional Requirements

Related to the LLM Service: 

    - The given chat must not give large answers without any reliable information. 

Related to the QuestionService: 

    - The time to response from the moment when a question is required to when it is printed on the screen must not be huge.

.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

|Goal|Description
| Testability | Our application is going to gave more than 85% of code coverage so the tests are going to be strong. 
| Usability | Our application is going to be very intuitive, allowing new users to navigate through it quickly. People from all ages will be checked that are capable of playing.
| Portability | Our application will allow its deployment of different devices at different times, without having a huge penalization on response times. 
| Security & Privacy | Our application will only allow the users themselves to see its own results, without considering some rankings that will involve all users. Also for entering into the application you must be authorized, you cannot jump through the url between different windows.
| Performance | Our application will be loading tests to confirm that runs correctly under “heavy conditions” in which there is much traffic of users. For example, for 10 users our application is going to answer in the same way, related with response times, than if there is only one user.

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
